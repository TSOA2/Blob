# Blob  
  
A line-oriented text editor for your text editing needs. Made as an educational exercise :)  
  
## About  
It was inspired by the 'ed' text editor, and uses lines as input, rather than keystrokes with ncurses.  
May not be as useful as modern text editors, but it's for fun and learning purposes.  
A usage is displayed when you run Blob without any args.  
 
This README was written using Blob as well! 
Blob has only been tested on GNU/Linux so far.
